# C4 Model

This folder contains a C4 depiction of the `MateMate` chess playing application. Compare in particular the [dependency graph](../plantuml/mate-mate-dependency-graph.pdf) from the [plantuml](../plantuml/) folder.

The depiction only uses the first three levels of the C4 model; the fourth level should describe the actual code in the components from the third level. There is not yet any code to describe however.
