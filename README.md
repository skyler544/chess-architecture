# Designing and Documenting Application Architecture

This repository contains diagrams and specification for an imaginary chess-playing application called `MateMate`.

## Contents

1. `plantuml/`: This subfolder documents the requirements of the chess application in the form of a dependency graph. See the [README](plantuml/README.md) in that folder for more details.
2. `c4/`: This subfolder documents the architecture of the chess application using the first three levels of the [C4 model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_model). See the [README](c4/README.md) in that folder for more details.
3. `arc42/`: This subfolder documents the architecture of the chess application using the [arc42](https://arc42.org/) documentation format. This document was almost entirely generated with the help of an AI Large Language Model using [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation). The information basis for the generation (aside from the model itself) was the dependency graph and the C4 model.
